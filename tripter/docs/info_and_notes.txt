* INFO AND NOTES: *
*******************

To run, use the test.py for now. In the future, bot.py will be used instead once the working components are moved over.
It will not post anything unless you confirm. Any images downloaded will be downloaded to "img" folder in the tripter root.
The text that will be in the tweet will be written to the txt file in the "txt" folder in the tripter root.

For overriding the gametag and time variables, put them in info.txt in the tripter root folder (example file included).
The gametag will always be included when trimming the tweet text.
